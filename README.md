This project focuses on visualizing housing tax assessment data using Python, specifically leveraging Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset (kc_tax.csv) contains information about property sizes and their assessed tax values.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Filtering:

Only properties with a tax-assessed value below $750,000 are considered.
Properties with a living area between 100 and 3,500 square feet are included to remove extreme outliers.
Hexbin Plot:

A hexagonal bin plot (hexbin) is used to visualize the relationship between total living space (SqFtTotLiving) and the tax-assessed value (TaxAssessedValue).
This helps identify density patterns in the dataset.
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plot:

A KDE plot is overlaid on the hexbin plot to show the probability distribution of house areas and tax values.
The KDE plot is adjusted to improve performance and readability.
Visualization & Analysis:

The results help in understanding property tax trends based on house size.
The code includes optimizations to handle large datasets efficiently.
Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data Visualization Techniques (Hexbin plots, KDE plots)
Filtering & Data Processing
The project aims to provide insights into housing tax assessments by visualizing patterns and trends in the dataset.
